<p>The Battery Package implements everything that has to do with a battery system itself.</p>
<p>The possibility exist to charge and discharge the batteries according to a certain strategy (to define) <a href=\"modelica://IDEAS.Electric.Battery.BatterySystemGeneral\">BatterySystemGeneral</a>.</p>
<p>The battery is modeled on system level. The SoC (State of Charge) of the battery is calculated with the energy flows. The models are:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Battery: Calculation of SoC.</li>
<li>BatteryCtrlGeneral: Depending on the current SoC of the battery system, it may be required to limit the power exchange.</li>
<li>BatterySystemGeneral: Total battery system with connection possibilities to the grid.</li>
</ol></p>
<p>The following battery parameters are included:</p>
<p><ol>
<li>Inverter efficienties: charging and discharging (grid <-> inverter)</li>
<li>Battery efficiencies: charging and discharging (invertor <-> battery)</li>
<li>Self-discharge: %/month</li>
<li>Ratio of maximum (dis)charging powers vs. nominal battery capacity</li>
</ol></p>

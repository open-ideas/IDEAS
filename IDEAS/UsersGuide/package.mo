<p>An <i><b>Integrated District Energy Assessment by Simulation</b></i> (<code>IDEAS</code>) tool is developed and allows integrated transient simulation of thermal and electrical processes at neighborhood level. The <code>IDEAS</code> tool differs from existing building physics and systems based and electrical energy system based models by integrating the dynamics of the hydronic, thermal as well as electrical energy networks at both the building and aggregated level within a single model and solver.</p>

Partial component to model a sensor.
The sensor is ideal. It does not influence mass, energy,
species or substance balance, and it has no flow friction.

June 19, 2015, by Michael Wetter:<br/>
Moved <code>m_flow_small</code> to the <code>Advanced</code> tab
as it usually need not be changed by the user.
Other models such as heat exchangers also have this parameter
on the <code>Advanced</code> tab.

First implementation.
Implementation is based on <code>Modelica.Fluid</code>.
